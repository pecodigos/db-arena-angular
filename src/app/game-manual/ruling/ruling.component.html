  <h2>The basics</h2>
  <h3>Selection Screen</h3>
  <mat-card>
    The first thing you will see when beginning a game of Dragon Ball-Arena is the screen below (without the big blue letters). This is the Fighter Selection screen and what ever is and does is explained below.

    <p>* <b>A</b>: This section displays your player information. It shows your avatar, username, ninja rank, ladder rank, win-loss record, and win-loss streak, all in that order.</p>
    <p>* <b>B</b>: This section has three boxes for you to drag and drop the ninjas you wish to use in your team. Only when you have selected three ninjas may you begin a match.</p>
    <p>* <b>C</b>: This is the character section. Each page has 21 characters on it and you use the white arrows to scroll through the pages. Some characters may appear grayed-out and you will not be able to drag these characters into your team. These characters are mission characters and you must complete their mission before you may use them.</p>
    <p>* <b>D</b>: This is where individual character information is displayed. By clicking on a character's icon in section 'C' this section will appear. The primary function of this section is so that you may study that character's skills.</p>
    <p>* <b>E</b>: By clicking on a skill icon of a character in section 'D' this section will display the information about that skill. The upper left red text is the name of the skill. The upper right is the energy cost of the skill. The center is the description of the skill, essentially saying what the skill does. The bottom left lists the classes of that skill. The bottom right displays that skill's cooldown.</p>
    <p>* <b>F</b>: The three buttons at the middle will begin a match with another opponent. There are three different types of games you may play. A ladder game is played against a random opponent near you on the ladder. This game type is the only way to increase your standing within the ladder. A quick game is played against a random opponent. This game does not count towards your ladder stats but does towards your missions. A private game works just like a quick game except that you must specify the particular opponent you wish to play against and your opponent must do the same.</p>

  <h3>Battle Screen</h3>
  <mat-card>
    The first thing you will see when beginning a game of Dragon Ball-Arena is the screen below (without the big blue letters). This is the Fighter Selection screen and what ever is and does is explained below.

    <p>* <b>A</b>: This section displays you and your opponent's avatars, the 'press when ready' button which is how you end your turn (this will say 'opponent's turn' when it is not your turn), a red and white bar which is your turn timer, and your energy pool. There are four types of energy in Naruto-Arena, Taijutsu (green), Bloodline (red), Ninjutsu (blue), and Genjutsu (white). The 'T' is your current total energy in your pool. With the exception of the first player to take a turn (they only receive one energy) you will receive a number of random energy equal to how many of your ninjas were alive at the end of your last turn.</p>
    <p>* <b>B</b>: This section displays your team and the current health of each fighter in it. Skills affecting these characters will also be shown here by small icons next to the character's icon. By scrolling your cursor over that icon a description of what the skill is doing will appear.</p>
    <p>* <b>C</b>: This section displays your opponent's team and functions just like section 'B'.</p>
    <p>* <b>D</b>: This is where your characters' skills are displayed. Each character can use one skill per turn, provided you have sufficient energy of the appropriate types to pay their costs. Any skill that cannot be used that turn for any reason is grayed-out. By clicking on a skill, viable targets for that skill with glow yellow, and you must then click on one of these viable targets for that skill to be used. When a skill has been selected for a character that turn, its icon will display in the gray '?' box. To deselect a skill, simply double-click its icon in the gray '?' box.</p>
    <p>* <b>E</b>: This section is exactly like section 'E' of the Fighter Selection screen.</p>
    <p>* <b>F</b>: This section is where you can choose to surrender a match, open a chat window with your opponent, or adjust the sound settings.</p>
  </mat-card>

  <h3>Abilities</h3>
  <mat-card>
    As mentioned above energy is used to perform abilities. Every ability uses a different set of energy. There are 4 types of energies:
    <p><br>Combat
    <br>Bloodline
    <br>Ki
    <br>Technique</p>

    <p>The chance to get a certain energy is 25% for each, as there are four types. This means that it is random, and that you can also get multiple energies of one type. Next to these 4 types, some skills require random energy . This kind of energy can be filled in by any of the types above.</p>
